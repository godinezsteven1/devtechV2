                                    This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to store datasets of American Sign Language (ASL),
                                    German Sign Language (DGS), and Spanish Sign Language (LSE). using a unified deep learning pipeline.
                                    Leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a custom-curated and standardized dataset,
                                    the system integrates MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking, TensorFlow for gesture classification, and
                                    natural language processing (NLP) for output refinement and translation. By accommodating overlapping 
                                    visual gestures across languages and correcting for class imbalances, the model offers robust, multilingual recognition.

                            The nature of a Natural Language Processing pipeline is to process human 
                            language and in our case mimic its structure. Initially, I believed a Hidden Markov 
                            Model would fit most appropriately as they are modeled to find the "probabilistic
                            relationship between a sequence of observations and a sequence of hidden states". 
                            However, due to the inclusion and complexity of day to day conversation. A model that assumes
                            each emission, observed word / token, is independent of the rest lacks to capture 
                            transitions states between words or better known as, context. My solution was to 
                            transition the classic HMM to a Bigram Hidden Markov Model. A Bigram Hidden Markov
                            models introduces dependencies to the previous observation, that help capture word state
                            transitions in a sequence, while eliminating emissions; each word its is own state and our 
                            algorithm tracks transition probabilities between words. This alongside with its limitations, 
                            gave a solution to state transitions that is able to keep context as the most probable 
                            next word sequence using a Viterbi algorithm that has a faster runtime. However, the BHMM is
                            still limited as it cannot accurately capture long term sequences with out it being 
                            computationally expensive where it slows down outputs, ruining the quality of the software.

                A keylogger is a type of surveillance software that records every keystroke made on a computer or mobile device. It can be used for various purposes, including monitoring user activity, capturing passwords, and tracking user behavior.

                Keyloggers can be implemented in hardware or software form. Hardware keyloggers are physical devices that are connected between the keyboard and the computer, while software keyloggers are installed on the device's operating system.

                While keyloggers can be used for legitimate purposes, such as parental control or employee monitoring, they can also be misused for malicious intent, leading to privacy violations and security breaches.
